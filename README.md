# AI-Powered Lyrics Generator

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered lyrics generator that mimics the style of famous artists like **J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Drake, Eminem, and The Weeknd** across various genres. Users can input a theme, and the AI generates lyrics that align with the selected artist‚Äôs style. The application is built using **Streamlit** and **Google's Gemini AI**.

## Features
- üé§ **Generate lyrics** in the style of famous artists
- üé∂ **Choose from multiple genres** (Hip-Hop, R&B, Pop, Rap, Soul)
- ‚úç **Customizable themes** for personalized lyrics
- ‚ö° **Real-time AI generation** powered by Google‚Äôs Gemini Pro model

## The Idea Behind the App
As a fan of **Hip-Hop, mainly Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole**, I wanted to create an AI-powered tool that generates lyrics similar to these great artists. The app provides users with the ability to **craft AI-generated lyrics** while preserving the unique style of each artist.

## How Prompting Techniques Were Applied
The application utilizes **prompt engineering techniques** to refine the output:

- **Contextual Prompting**: The AI is given clear instructions about the desired artist, genre, and theme to generate relevant lyrics.
- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Future updates may include examples of lyrics before the AI generates its own to refine the response further.
- **Iterative Prompting**: Users can refine inputs and re-generate lyrics for improved results.
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Structured prompts help guide the AI to ensure coherence across verses and rhymes.

## Parameters Tweaked and Why
To optimize lyric generation, we fine-tuned several AI parameters:

- **Temperature (0.7‚Äì0.9)**: Controls creativity, ensuring diverse yet coherent responses.
- **Top-P (0.8‚Äì0.95)**: Allows diverse word choices for engaging lyrics.
- **Max Tokens**: Limits response length to prevent overly long or irrelevant lyrics.
- **Presence & Frequency Penalty**: Tweaked to minimize repetition, ensuring natural-sounding lyrics.
